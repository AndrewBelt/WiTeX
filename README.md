# WiTeX
*If Donald Knuth had designed Wikipedia*

## Install
If you have a Wikipedia account, open your [Preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences), go to the Appearance tab, and edit the Custom CSS for the Vector skin.
Paste the contents of [`style.css`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewBelt/WiTeX/master/style.css) into the editor, and save.
For better alignment of mathematical equations, enable MathML or Mathjax in the Appearance tab.

Alternatively, you can load the CSS using a browser plugin (such as [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)) for the domain `https?://*.wikipedia.org`.


#### I want the old Wikipedia design back!
While logged in, go to the [edit `vector.css` page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MyPage/vector.css&action=edit), delete the contents, and save.
