# WiTeX
*If Donald Knuth had designed Wikipedia*

## Install
If you have a Wikipedia account, open your [Preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences), go to the Appearance tab, and edit the Custom CSS for the Vector skin.
Paste [`style.css`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewBelt/WiTeX/master/style.css) into the code editor, and save.

Alternatively, you can load the CSS using a browser plugin for the domain `https?://*.wikipedia.org`.


### I want the old Wikipedia design back!

There is no longer a Preferences link at the top of the page, but you can click to the following URL.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences

Change the skin to something else, apply, and remove the Custom CSS from the Vector skin.

Or, you could manually go to this URL, inserting your Wikipedia username.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:**your-username**/vector.css&action=edit
